## Leaflet Earthquake Visualization

### Challenge Overview

This challenge uses Leaflet.js to create an interactive map that visualizes earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goal is to display earthquake occurrences with markers that vary in size and color based on magnitude and depth, allowing users to easily interpret seismic activity visually.

## Features

* Dynamic Earthquake Markers: Earthquake markers are sized based on magnitude and colored based on depth, giving an immediate visual representation of seismic activity.
* Interactive Popups: Clickable markers provide detailed information about each earthquake, including location, magnitude, and depth.
* Legend: A legend explains the color scale used for depth, helping users understand the data at a glance.

# Data Source
The earthquake data is fetched from the USGS GeoJSON Feed, which provides real-time updates on global earthquake activity.

## File Structure

* index.html: Main HTML file that sets up the webpage and links to the Leaflet library, CSS, and JavaScript files.
* static/css/style.css: Contains the styling for the map and legend.
* static/js/logic.js: Contains the JavaScript logic for fetching, processing, and displaying the earthquake data on the map.

## Technologies Used

* Leaflet.js: For rendering the interactive map and markers.
* D3.js: For fetching and processing the GeoJSON data.
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Core technologies for building the webpage and implementing interactivity.

### Conclusion

This challenge provides an engaging way to visualize earthquake data, helping to increase public awareness and understanding of seismic activities worldwide.
